Exit code is 1 if anything in the HARD list is present. Those are mechanical
and there is never a reason to ship one.

The WARN list is heuristic. A hit is not proof, but every hit has to be looked
at and consciously kept, because these are the shapes that survive a clean
vocabulary sweep. Three times now the banned words were all absent and the
structure gave it away anyway.

What no script can check is printed at the end. Read it and do it by eye. The
rule in the project notes is "the grep is not the sweep", and this file is the grep.

Code blocks, bbcode [code] sections, checksum lines and URLs are stripped
before checking, because those are exempt and full of false positives.

Now the part no script can do. Reread the whole piece and answer these:

  1. Does the opening line say something, or does it announce the shape of the
     piece? Cut it if it is announcing. The verdict openers are mechanical now;
     this question is about the ones no list has caught yet.
  2. Does the last paragraph add anything, or restate and then moralise? End on
     what the reader does next.
  3. Read the previous two documents of this kind. Does this one share their
     skeleton with the labels swapped?
  4. Any move that is becoming a signature? Performed honesty, the
     self-deprecating fix introduction, the same joke shape twice.
  5. Read it aloud. Two sentences in a row with the same rhythm get rewritten.
