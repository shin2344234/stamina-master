"""Look up, and optionally submit, the release files on VirusTotal.

    py -3 vtscan.py             report what VirusTotal already knows
    py -3 vtscan.py --upload    submit anything it has never seen, then wait
    py -3 vtscan.py --prose     also print the paragraphs the README and the
                                Nexus description want, with the numbers filled in

Synced from release-kit. Do not edit it here; the next sync overwrites it.

Run package.ps1 first: this reads the two archives and the plugin out of dist
and takes the version from the header named in release.json, so the three
files it reports are the three the release actually ships.

Needs a key in VT_API_KEY. Get one by signing in at virustotal.com and opening
the API key page from the account menu. The free key is enough: the limits are
500 requests a day at four a minute, and a release costs six. The free key may
not be used commercially, which this is not.

Nexus submits the DMM archive by itself when a file is uploaded, so that one
usually has a report before this script asks. The loose plugin never does, and
the plugin's number is the one worth quoting, because the scanners are
objecting to the PE rather than to a zip container.
