.SYNOPSIS
    Publish the current release to the Stamina Master mod page.

.DESCRIPTION
    A wrapper around Publish-NexusModUpdate.ps1 that fills in the three things
    that never change and the two that follow from the version, so a release
    does not depend on remembering an id.

        Mod id  not set yet       the v3 id, not the number in the page URL
        File id not set yet      the active "StaminaMaster ... DMM" entry

    Neither is set. The mod page does not exist yet, so 1.0.0 is created and
    uploaded by hand; this wrapper is for the releases after it. Run

        py -3 nexus-ids.py

    once the page is up and paste what it reads back. The file id is the one
    worth being careful about: point a release at the wrong one and it attaches
    as a version of some other file.

    The version comes from mod/src/version.h, and the archive and changelog are
    derived from it, so this only ever publishes what package.ps1 built.

    Report only unless you pass -Apply, same as the script it wraps.

    The previous version is left listed, never archived. Archiving hides it,
    and people who need an older build (kfen72 asked, 9 September 2026) then
    have nothing to download. What it should become is an Old files entry,
    and the v3 API cannot do that: updateModFile changes the name and nothing
    else, and the category enum for a new file has no old_version value. So
    after -Apply, open Manage Files on the mod page and move the previous
    version to Old files by hand. -ArchivePrevious is there for the one case
    where an old build must be pulled outright.

    .\publish-nexus.ps1
    .\publish-nexus.ps1 -Apply

    [string] $Version,

    # Archive the previous version. Off by default: archiving hides it, and an
    # older build should stay downloadable under Old files, which is a manual
    # move on the site because the API cannot set that category.
    [switch] $ArchivePrevious
