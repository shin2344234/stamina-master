.SYNOPSIS
    Publish the current release to the Stamina Master mod page.

.DESCRIPTION
    A wrapper around Publish-NexusModUpdate.ps1 that fills in the three things
    that never change and the two that follow from the version, so a release
    does not depend on remembering an id.

        Mod id  not set yet       the v3 id, not the number in the page URL
        File id not set yet      the active "StaminaMaster ... DMM" entry

    Neither is set. The mod page does not exist yet, so 1.0.0 is created and
    uploaded by hand; this wrapper is for the releases after it. Run

        py -3 nexus-ids.py

    once the page is up and paste what it reads back. The file id is the one
    worth being careful about: point a release at the wrong one and it attaches
    as a version of some other file.

    The version comes from mod/src/version.h, and the archive and changelog are
    derived from it, so this only ever publishes what package.ps1 built.

    Report only unless you pass -Apply, same as the script it wraps.

    The previous version is left listed, never archived. Archiving hides it,
    and people who need an older build (kfen72 asked, 9 September 2026) then
    have nothing to download. Nothing has to be done by hand for that: Nexus
    demotes the previous file to old_version on its own once the new one goes
    up as primary, and an old_version file keeps its download button and only
    loses the headline slot. Confirmed against Master Looter page 3402, where
    1.6.32 and every build before it read old_version and all download.
    -ArchivePrevious is the opt-in for pulling a build outright, which is the
    thing Seth does not want.

    # owed here.

# The changelog endpoint appends rather than replaces, so a second run for one

# The two ids from nexus-ids.py, in one place. They were written out twice,

# 1.0.0 was uploaded by hand. They are stable for the life of the page. Get
