.SYNOPSIS
    Publish the current release to both file entries on the mod's Nexus page.

.DESCRIPTION
    Synced from release-kit. Do not edit it here; the next sync overwrites it.

    A wrapper around Publish-NexusModUpdate.ps1. The ids come from the nexus
    block in release.json, and the archives and changelog follow from the
    version, so a release does not depend on remembering an id. Check the ids
    against the live page with nexus-ids.py.

    One run updates both entries:
      1. the DMM entry (dmmFileId) with <fileBase>-<version>-DMM.zip, as the
         primary mod-manager download, carrying the changelog and setting the
         page version
      2. the manual entry (manualFileId) with <fileBase>-<version>.zip, with no
         changelog, since the first upload already posted it

    A page with no manual entry yet (manualFileId empty) gets one: the manual
    archive goes up as a new file entry through POST /mod-files, and the new id
    is written into release.json. Commit that change with the release's
    antivirus commit.

    The changelog endpoint appends rather than replaces, so publishing one
    version twice posts the text twice. Before sending, this asks the API what
    each entry already lists. A version counts as already there only when it is
    not archived or removed, and when its archive is the same size as the local
    one, read from the v1 files list, because the v3 versions list does not say
    which archive a version holds. A match is skipped, which makes a second run
    safe after the first failed half way. A version that is there with a
    different archive stops the run, since that is a wrong upload to repair,
    and the repair command is printed.

    The previous version is left listed, never archived. Nexus demotes it to
    old_version on its own once the new one goes up, and an old_version file
    keeps its download button. -ArchivePrevious pulls a build outright, which
    is the thing Seth does not want.

    Report only unless you pass -Apply.

    .\publish-nexus.ps1 -Apply
