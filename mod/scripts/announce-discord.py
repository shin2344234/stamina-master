"""Post a release to the Discord server's mod-releases channel.

    py -3 announce-discord.py            print what would be posted
    py -3 announce-discord.py --apply    post it

Reads the version from version.h and posts private/discord/release-<version>.txt
as it is: two or three plain lines saying what changed, then the Nexus files
page and the GitHub release. Write that file first and read it over; the
script refuses without it, and refuses if either link is missing.

Posts as the bot, using DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN from the environment or from
keys.local.env beside this script, the same file the Nexus and VirusTotal
scripts read. It was written against a webhook that this project has never
had, which is why every announcement so far has gone out by hand.

The channel is mod-releases, and its id is below rather than in the key file
because a channel id is not a secret. DISCORD_RELEASES_CHANNEL overrides it.

Refuses to post a version twice: a marker is written under private/discord
after a successful post and checked before the next one.
