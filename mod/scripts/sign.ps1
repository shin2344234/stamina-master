.SYNOPSIS
    Sign the plugin with Azure Trusted Signing, then verify it.

.DESCRIPTION
    Synced from release-kit. Do not edit it here; the next sync overwrites it.

    Runs signtool with the Azure Trusted Signing dlib against the account in
    private\signing.json (endpoint, account name, certificate profile; no
    secrets). The credential is the Azure CLI login, so `az login` once on
    this machine is the whole setup. The certificate is issued to Seth Walker
    under Microsoft's identity-verified chain, and every mod signs with it.

    The signtool that works is the one beside the dlib in private\tools, the
    copy vpk ships. The Windows SDK's own signtool ignores the dlib and fails
    with "No certificates were found that met all the given criteria".

    Sign before package.ps1, never after: the archives carry the plugin and
    the checksums on the Nexus page are of the signed file. An unsigned binary
    with no history is what the antivirus models react to, and a
    Microsoft-issued signature carries reputation from one release to the next.

.EXAMPLE
    .\sign.ps1                       signs <dist>\<fileBase>.asi from release.json
    .\sign.ps1 -Path some\other.dll  signs that file instead
    .\sign.ps1 -VerifyOnly           reports the signature already on the file
